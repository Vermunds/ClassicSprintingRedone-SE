# ClassicSprintingRedone-SE
A mod for the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.

This mod will make the sprinting work the same way as it did in old Skyrim. What it makes different from other similar mods that this will modify the code directly, so it doesn't rely on external scripts anymore. It works with keyboards and controllers too.
